RoyalTS API
===========

Get the required files, by doing a:
````
npm install
````

The idea is pretty simple, you can start up this API which will expose a /api url on port 7000.
Then you have to POST a json payload to it in order for it to generate a valid Royal TS document.

It will automaticly give you back the document in XML format.

Example data is in the src/server.js at the bottom.
